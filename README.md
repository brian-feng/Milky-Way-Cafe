# Pasta-Point-of-No-Return  

Our pasta, who art in a colander,
draining be your noodles. 
Thy noodle come, thy Sauce be yum, 
on top some grated Parmsan.

Give us this day our garlic bread,
and forgive us our indulgences, 
as we forgive those who reality TV.

And lead us not into vegetarianism,
but deliver us some pizza, 
for thine is the meatball,
and the sauce,
forever and ever.
